export const greenPapayaSaladInstructions = [
  "In a large mortar and pestle, pound the garlic and chilies until they form a rough paste. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, finely mince them together.",
  "Add the palm sugar, fish sauce, and lime juice to the mortar and mix well until the sugar is dissolved. Taste and adjust the seasoning - it should be equally sour, salty, and sweet.",
  "Add the dried shrimp (if using) and lightly pound to break them up.",
  "Add the long beans and lightly pound to bruise them, which helps them absorb the dressing.",
  "Add the tomatoes and lightly pound just until they're slightly bruised.",
  "Add the shredded green papaya and Thai eggplant (if using). Using a spoon and the pestle, mix everything together, pressing down to bruise the papaya slightly and allow it to absorb the dressing.",
  "Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed by adding more lime juice, fish sauce, or sugar.",
  "Transfer to a serving plate and sprinkle with the chopped peanuts.",
  "Serve immediately with cabbage wedges and sticky rice on the side."

export const greenPapayaSaladTips = [
  "To shred the green papaya: Peel the papaya, then use a papaya shredder or a sharp knife to make long, thin strips. You can also use a julienne peeler or a box grater.",
  "Adjust the number of chilies based on your spice tolerance. Traditional Thai som tam is quite spicy with 4-10 chilies.",
  "If you can't find green papaya, you can substitute with green mango or even cucumber, though the texture and flavor will be different.",
  "For a vegetarian version, replace the fish sauce with soy sauce or salt, and omit the dried shrimp.",
  "The dressing should have a balance of sour, salty, and sweet flavors. Adjust to your preference.",
  "Som tam is traditionally eaten with sticky rice and grilled meats like gai yang (Thai grilled chicken).",
  "For an authentic experience, serve with raw vegetables like cabbage, green beans, and Thai eggplant."

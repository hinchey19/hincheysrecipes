export const padThaiIngredients = [
  "8 oz pad Thai rice noodles (stir-fry rice noodles)",
  "2 tablespoons vegetable or peanut oil",
  "1-2 shallots, sliced (or sub ¼ cup red onion)",
  "4 garlic cloves, chopped",
  "2 eggs, whisked with a fork",
  "1-2 cups bean sprouts",
  "½ cup chopped scallions",
  "½ cup chopped peanuts (optional)",
  "2-3 lime wedges (essential!)",
  "8 oz tofu or chicken breast, or shrimp (optional)",
  "For the sauce:",
  "3 tablespoons fish sauce",
  "3 tablespoons brown sugar or palm sugar",
  "3 tablespoons rice vinegar (or tamarind paste, or white vinegar with a splash of lime)",
  "1 tablespoon soy sauce",
  "1-3 teaspoons sriracha or chili garlic sauce (optional)"

export const padThaiInstructions = [
  "Cook the rice noodles according to the package directions, making sure to slightly undercook as they will continue to cook in the wok. Rinse in cool water, drain well, and set aside.",
  "Mix the Pad Thai sauce ingredients together in a small bowl - fish sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sriracha.",
  "Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. If adding protein (like chicken, tofu, or shrimp), cook it first until nearly done, then set aside.",
  "Add shallots and garlic to the wok, stir fry for 1 minute until fragrant.",
  "Push the vegetables to the side, creating a well in the center. Add a little more oil if needed, then pour in the whisked eggs, letting them cook slightly before breaking them apart.",
  "Add the cooked rice noodles and the prepared sauce to the wok. Toss and stir fry for 2-3 minutes until the noodles have absorbed the sauce.",
  "If using a pre-cooked protein, add it back to the wok now and toss to combine.",
  "Add the bean sprouts and most of the scallions (save some for garnish), tossing for just 30-60 seconds until slightly wilted but still crunchy.",
  "Taste and adjust by adding more fish sauce for saltiness, more sriracha for heat, or more lime for tanginess.",
  "Serve immediately in bowls, garnished with remaining scallions, chopped peanuts, extra bean sprouts, and lime wedges."

export const padThaiTips = [
  "For best results, have all ingredients prepped and ready before you start cooking, as this dish comes together quickly.",
  "To make this gluten-free, use gluten-free soy sauce or tamari.",
  "For a vegetarian version, replace fish sauce with more soy sauce and a splash of lime.",
  "Protein options: Use 8 oz of cubed firm tofu, thinly sliced chicken breast, or peeled and deveined shrimp.",
  "Make sure not to overcook the noodles initially, as they will continue to soften in the wok.",
  "The lime wedges aren't just garnish - a generous squeeze of fresh lime juice right before eating is essential for authentic flavor."

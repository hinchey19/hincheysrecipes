export const spicyTunaRollsInstructions = [
  "In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved. Fold this mixture into your warm cooked sushi rice and let it cool to room temperature.",
  "In another bowl, combine the diced tuna, mayonnaise, sriracha, sesame oil, and sliced green onion. Mix gently until well combined.",
  "Place a bamboo sushi rolling mat on a clean surface and cover it with plastic wrap to prevent sticking.",
  "Lay a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the mat.",
  "With wet hands (to prevent sticking), spread about 3/4 cup of the prepared sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving about 1 inch of nori uncovered at the top edge.",
  "Sprinkle some sesame seeds over the rice.",
  "Flip the nori sheet so the rice is facing down on the bamboo mat and the exposed nori is facing up.",
  "Spread about 2-3 tablespoons of the spicy tuna mixture in a line across the center of the nori. If using, add slices of avocado and/or cucumber strips alongside the tuna.",
  "Using the bamboo mat as a guide, tightly roll the nori and rice over the filling, applying gentle pressure as you roll.",
  "Continue rolling until you reach the exposed edge of nori. Wet the exposed edge slightly to help seal the roll.",
  "Use the bamboo mat to shape and firm up the roll by applying gentle pressure.",
  "With a sharp, wet knife, slice the roll into 8 pieces. Clean and wet the knife between cuts for cleaner slices.",
  "Arrange the spicy tuna rolls on a serving plate and serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger."

export const spicyTunaRollsTips = [
  "For the best texture, use fresh sushi-grade tuna from a reputable fishmonger or Japanese market.",
  "Keep a small bowl of water nearby to wet your hands when handling the rice to prevent sticking.",
  "The sharper your knife, the cleaner your cuts will be. A wet knife also helps prevent sticking.",
  "If you're new to rolling sushi, don't overfill your rolls - it makes them harder to roll tightly.",
  "For extra crunch, you can add tempura flakes to your spicy tuna mixture.",
  "Make sure your rice has cooled to room temperature before rolling to prevent the nori from becoming soggy.",
  "For an inside-out roll (rice on the outside), cover your bamboo mat with plastic wrap to prevent sticking."

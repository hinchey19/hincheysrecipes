  "They taste best the day they are made, but they can be stored for 2-3 days, wrapped individually and stored in an air-tight container in the refrigerator.",
  "When rolling, make sure to keep the spring roll tight. Since the rice paper is pretty sticky, it will quickly adhere as you're rolling.",
  "You can add the sauce in the filling lightly before rolling it up to give them more flavor, or serve it on the side for dipping.",
  "Place a damp paper towel on top of the finished rolls to keep them fresh while you prepare the rest.",
  "For best results, work with one rice paper at a time as they can become too sticky if left wet for too long."

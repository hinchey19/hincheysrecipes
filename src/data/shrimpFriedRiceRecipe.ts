  "Heat 1 tablespoon of avocado oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp to a plate and set aside.",
  "Add the beaten eggs to the same pan and quickly scramble them for about 30 seconds. Remove them to the same plate as the shrimp.",
  "Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan along with the diced onion, carrots, and white parts of the green onions. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened.",
  "Add the minced garlic and sauté for another 30 seconds, or until fragrant.",
  "Add the cooked and chilled rice to the pan, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Stir fry for 2-3 minutes.",
  "Add the frozen peas and stir for another minute.",
  "Return the cooked shrimp and scrambled eggs to the pan and stir to combine.",
  "Pour the tamari soy sauce and sesame oil over the rice mixture and stir until everything is well coated and heated through.",
  "Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
  "Garnish with the sliced green parts of the green onions before serving."

export const shrimpFriedRiceTips = [
  "Use day-old, cold rice for the best texture. Freshly cooked rice can become mushy when stir-fried.",
  "Make sure all your ingredients are prepped before you start cooking, as stir-frying moves quickly.",
  "Don't overcook the shrimp - they only need about 1-2 minutes per side until they turn pink and opaque.",
  "For a gluten-free version, use tamari or coconut aminos instead of regular soy sauce.",
  "Feel free to customize with other vegetables like bell peppers, broccoli, or snap peas.",
  "For extra flavor, add a dash of fish sauce or oyster sauce.",
  "Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."

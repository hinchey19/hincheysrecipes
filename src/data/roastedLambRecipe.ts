export const roastedLambInstructions = [
  "Clean and Trim – Wash the lamb leg thoroughly and pat it dry. Trim off excess fat (optional if you like fatty meat).",
  "Scoring – Make a few cuts on the surface of the lamb leg. Score in a crisscross pattern on one side and diagonal cuts on the other. This helps the marinade penetrate better.",
  "Marinate – Massage the lamb leg with onion, ginger, garlic, cooking wine, soy sauces, salt, sugar, black pepper, chili powder (optional), and BBQ seasoning. Let it sit for at least 2–3 hours (overnight for deeper flavor).",
  "Preheat the Oven – Set the oven to 365°F (185°C).",
  "Wrap and Roast – Wrap the marinated lamb leg in foil and roast for 1 hour.",
  "Unwrap and Crisp – Remove the foil, brush the lamb leg with oil, sprinkle more BBQ seasoning, and roast for another 40 minutes, flipping once midway.",
  "Optional: Air Fryer for Crispy Finish – If you prefer extra crispiness, after roasting, coat the lamb with honey water, cumin, and chili powder. Air fry at 370°F (188°C) for 8 minutes until golden and crispy."
